# Driving-Semantics-SNN
The implementation of the paper "Understanding human common driving semantics for autonomous vehicles". The abstract is "Autonomous vehicles will share the road with human-driven vehicles during the transition to full autonomy transport networks. The challenge of co-existence requires autonomous vehicles to understand human common driving behaviors analogously to experienced human drivers. In this work, we design and conduct two electroencephalography experiments to compare the cerebral activities of human linguistic and driving thinking. From the experiments we present biological findings that human cerebral driving thinking activates similar hierarchical neural functions in the auditory cortex to linguistic thinking. We subsequently propose a semantics-driven framework to understand human common driving behavior in a brain-inspired manner, which endows autonomous vehicles with the ability to perceive and think in a similar manner to human drivers. Moreover, we demonstrate a prototypical implementation using realistic driving trajectories. The results provide computationally explicit evidence that this work can inspire the bionic design of next-generation human-like autonomous vehicles, and benefit future bio-inspired human-machine interaction research in other disciplines".
It contains five files based on jupyter notebook to process the data, train the model, and predict multi-step topics and speed.
